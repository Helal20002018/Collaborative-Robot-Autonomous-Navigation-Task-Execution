# Collaborative-Robot-Autonomous-Navigation-Task-Execution

-- Project Overview

This project was developed on the AgileX Cobot, an autonomous mobile robot equipped with a robotic arm.
The focus was on upgrading the control system, integrating advanced task execution strategies, and enhancing autonomy using ROS Behavior Trees for multi-task management.
